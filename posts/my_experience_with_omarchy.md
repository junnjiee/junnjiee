synopsis: And why you should try it too.

[Omarchy](https://omarchy.org) is amazing. 

It is a modern, opinionated [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) set-up (by [DHH](https://dhh.dk)) that allows you to use it as a daily driver right out of the box. 

More than that, the power of Omarchy is that it is easily extensible and configurable. The whole set-up is also fully transparent, as it is configured using shell scripts.

## Why Omarchy?

For someone who has been trying to explore more of what Linux offers for a while now, It has been a daunting experience. From scrolling endless man pages (#RTFM) to fixing a broken config every now and then, my system has made me more unproductive rather than helping me improve my workflow.

However, Omarchy changed the entire experience for me. There is a certain excitement in using an environment knowing that you are fully in control, and that is the beauty of Linux in general. More importantly, it allowed me to understand what a good Linux rice should feel like: smooth, productive and easily configurable.

## But MacOS/Windows already works fine!

I agree. However, if you have never gave Linux a try before, there has never a better time to do it! Great support and community, open-source, loads of tutorials online on how to get started, and it can probably run well on a 10-year old laptop! Omarchy is also a good opportunity to escape the ads and AI bloat the *mainstream OSes* try to push to consumers nowadays.

Also, no prior programming or Linux experience is needed to get started with Omarchy! Reading [The Omarchy Manual](https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual) is enough.

With Omarchy, maybe the *Year of the Linux Desktop* might not be a joke anymore...
